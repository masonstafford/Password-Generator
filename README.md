# Password-Generator
Password Generator Using JS:

Project description: Make a password generator that meets specific criteria based of the users input and interaction with the site.

Tasks accomplished in this project:
After the user clicks the “Generate Password” button:
Confirm whether or not the user wants, uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters to be generated randomly into the password.
Prompt the user to enter a number of how many characters they would like to be in their password (must be between 8 – 128 characters).
If the user enters less than 8 or over 128 characters, then an alert will run asking the user to use the recommended character amount and then will return back to the prompt.
After the users inputs have been confirmed, a strong password meeting all the users criteria will be displayed on the screen.
